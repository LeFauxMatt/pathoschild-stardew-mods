**Central Station** lets you travel to other mods' destinations by boat, bus, or train. You can also get a ticket to
the Central Station to change line, visit the gift shop, and more.

Mod authors can add custom destinations with optional ticket prices, add ticket machines to their locations, and extend
the Central Station location with their own content like tourists and bookshelf messages.
